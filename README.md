# thesis-hawking-stephen-pdf-numerisation-project
Here is the colored reference pdf of his PhD. Feel free to feed the corresponding PAGES/ numerized **latex** version (by hand, or OCR) p....tex in p... directory, **from page p013, idle**. If you can, complete the wiki too.

For Latex of PAGES/, each page = directory is the charge of 1 person. Keep article document so that each page is self sufficient and independent from other pages. 

For Wiki, like Wikipedia everybody can act to everything.

In BOOK/, contribute in adding a script which collects each page of PAGES/.
