Here is the colored reference pdf. Feel free to feed the corresponding numerized latex version (by hand, or OCR) p....tex in p... directory, **from page p013**. If you can, complete the wiki too.

For **Latex**, each page = directory is the charge of 1 person. Keep article document so that each page is self sufficient and independent from other pages.
For Wiki, like Wikipedia.
